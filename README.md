# Sign-Language-Detection-using-Keras-and-OpenCV
This project is all about detecting the american sign language in real time. Sign Language is used primarily for deaf people where different signs are used to communicate with them. We have collected the american sign language dataset through kaggle for training and validation purpose. OpenCV is then used for real time sign language detection.
